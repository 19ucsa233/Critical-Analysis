Trapping AI solution to improve Cybersecurity
ABSTRACT 
A number of governments have taken anti-cybercrime actions right now, and several companies have been doing the same.The explosion of the internet provides a variety of possibilities for communication, finding information, and many other ventures turning into an essential tool in our modern everyday life. The growth of the cyber threats and cybercriminals always remain unchanged cyber crimes are increasingly civilized with their methods. Information has become one of the biggest challenges in the present day when we think about cyber security, there are so many cyber-attacks and threats. In advanced artificial intelligence (AI) in particular machine learning and deep learning which focus on data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy in this article it is discussed to explore AI potential improving cybersecurity solutions by showing both its strength and weakness also discussed about future research occasion associated with the development of AI techniques in the cybersecurity field across a range of application domain.
